I am a Marketing & Branding Planner based in Tokyo Japan. I develop, support, and manage branding, business development, and strategic marketing projects. These projects include the business development and strategic marketing plans of three Japanese boutique advertising agencies, branding work for NYK and FUJI FILM, and market entry presentations for a portfolio of Barbadian consumer brands. 
As a freelancer, I am working as a Brand Advisor for Native Creative Y.K., a Marketing and Branding Advisor for AdPlatz Inc., & Marketing & Campaign Coordinator for CDSMP. In these roles, I present and report directly to the CEOs/founders on matters related to creative direction, business development, and marketing strategy.
